This is a crappily-designed attempt at a Roku remote app for FirefoxOS. Chances
are, you will get no particular use out of it, but if you do, hey, good on me!

Currently, you have to host this yourself somewhere. Eventually, I'll make a
gh-pages branch here and it will be appropriately hosted. That requires
effort :sweat_drops:
